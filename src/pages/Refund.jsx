        <p>
          Thank you for choosing ExBot for your WhatsApp Chatbot service needs.
          We strive to provide high-quality services to all our customers.
          Please review our Refund Policy carefully.

          <li>Refund Eligibility</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          1.1. Non-Refundable After Execution: All purchases and subscriptions
          for our WhatsApp Chatbot services are non-refundable once the service
          has been executed or the subscription has been approved. This
          includes, but is not limited to, access to the chatbot, activation of
          services, and any customization or integration work completed.
        </p>

        <p>
          1.2. Refund Requests: Refund requests will only be considered if made
          before the execution of the service or approval of the subscription.
          Once the service is executed or the subscription is approved, refunds
          are not applicable.
        </p>

        </ol>

        <p>
          2.1. Subscription Approval: Upon approval of your subscription, you
          will receive immediate access to the subscribed services. Due to the
          digital nature of our services, refunds cannot be issued after this
          point.
        </p>

        <p>
          2.2. Cancellation: You may cancel your subscription at any time by
          contacting our customer support at exbotcare@gmail.com. Cancellation
          will prevent future charges but will not entitle you to a refund for
          any fees already paid.

          3.1. Product Access: Once purchased, access to products or services is
          considered delivered. Therefore, refunds are not available for
          products once they have been accessed or used.
